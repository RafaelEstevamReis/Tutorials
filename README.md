## English repository
To increase the reach, this repository is mainly English

If you don't know how to write in English, write booth versions using a translator for the English, later some one fix it with proper writing

Example in C

~~~
// This funcion sum two numbers
// [PT] Está função soma dois números
int sum(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
~~~

Or, if a translation is pending:

~~~
// [AUTO] This funcion sum two numbers
// [PT] Está função soma dois números
int sum(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
~~~
